# 🚖 Uber Rides Analysis

Welcome to the **Uber Rides Analysis** project! 🚗📊 This project explores an Uber dataset to uncover insights related to ride frequency, durations, distances, and popular locations.

## 📂 Project Overview

This repository contains the analysis of Uber ride data, including visualizations and models to:

1. **Peak Hour Analysis** 🕐 - Identify the most popular hours of the day.
2. **Route Mapping** 🗺️ - Visualize start and stop locations on an interactive map.
3. **Ride Duration Analysis** ⏱️ - Analyze the distribution of ride durations.
4. **Distance vs. Duration** 📏 - Explore the correlation between distance and ride time.
5. **Clustering of Popular Locations** 🌍 - Identify clusters of popular Uber ride locations.
6. **Outlier Detection** 🚨 - Detect unusual trips that may be extremely short or long.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** 📊
- **NumPy** 🔢
- **Matplotlib** 🎨
- **Seaborn** 📈
- **Folium** 🗺️
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖
- **SciPy** 🔬

## 📊 Key Features

### 1. Peak Hour Analysis 📅
- **Objective:** Visualize the most popular hours for Uber rides.
- **Method:** A count plot of the ride frequency per hour of the day.

### 2. Route Mapping 🗺️
- **Objective:** Show start and stop locations on an interactive map.
- **Method:** Use Folium to plot random start/stop locations on a map.

### 3. Ride Duration Analysis ⏱️
- **Objective:** Analyze the distribution of ride durations.
- **Method:** Calculate the ride duration from start and end times, and visualize it.

### 4. Distance vs. Duration 📏
- **Objective:** Explore the correlation between the distance of the ride and its duration.
- **Method:** Use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship.

### 5. Clustering: Identifying Popular Locations 🌍
- **Objective:** Identify popular Uber ride locations using KMeans clustering.
- **Method:** Cluster locations on a Folium map, highlighting popular zones.

### 6. Outlier Detection 🚨
- **Objective:** Flag unusual rides with abnormally long or short durations.
- **Method:** Z-score technique to detect extreme values.

## 💻 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uber-rides-analysis.git
   cd uber-rides-analysis
2. Install Required Libraries
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the analysis
   ```bash
   python uber_analysis.py
### 4. Open the generated maps (uber_routes_map.html and uber_clusters_map.html) in your browser to explore.

## 🔍 Dataset Details

The dataset used contains Uber ride details, including the following columns:

- **START_DATE**: The start date and time of the ride.
- **END_DATE**: The end date and time of the ride.
- **START**: The start location of the ride.
- **STOP**: The stop location of the ride.
- **MILES**: The distance traveled during the ride (in miles).
